# Properties declaration of users for the realm 'ManagementRealm' which is the default realm
# for new AS 7.1 installations. Further authentication mechanism can be configured
# as part of the <management /> in standalone.xml.
#
# Users can be added to this properties file at any time, updates after the server has started
# will be automatically detected.
#
# By default the properties realm expects the entries to be in the format: -
# username=HEX( MD5( username ':' realm ':' password))
#
# The following illustrates how an admin user could be defined, this
# is for illustration only and does not correspond to a usable password.
